# Credit-Card-Routing-for-Online-Purchase-A-Predictive-Modelling-Approach
This work presents a case study aimed at improving online credit card payment processing for PaySmart by implementing a predictive modeling approach for transaction routing. The existing system faced challenges such as a high failure rate for transactions, resulting in financial losses and lower customer satisfaction. The study proposes replacing the static routing logic with a dynamic model that considers various transaction factors, including amount of payment, credit card type, and historical success rates.

The data collected consists of over 50,000 transaction instances, which underwent preprocessing and exploratory data analysis to ensure quality and relevance. Key insights reveal a concerning success rate of only 20.3%, prompting the need for a robust modeling strategy. The modeling phase utilized several machine learning techniques, with a multi-nominal logistic regression serving as the baseline model. Advanced models, including Random Forest and Gradient Boosting, were subsequently evaluated.

The final model, Gradient Boosting, achieved a substantial increase in success rates to 68.44% and reduced average transaction costs by 13.25%. The results highlight critical factors influencing payment outcomes, such as transaction amounts and the use of secure cards. The implementation of this predictive model is expected to enhance customer satisfaction by lowering costs and improving transaction success, thereby reinforcing PaySmart's competitive position in the market.

This study emphasizes the strategic value of integrating machine learning into financial processes to optimize routing decisions, ultimately benefiting both customers and the organization. The successful deployment of this model will involve ongoing monitoring and adjustments to adapt to changing transaction patterns and ensure sustained effectiveness.
