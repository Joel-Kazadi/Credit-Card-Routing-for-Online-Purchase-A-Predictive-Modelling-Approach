# Credit-Card-Routing-for-Online-Purchase-A-Predictive-Modelling-Approach
The project develops a predictive model for PaySmart to improve online credit card transaction routing, addressing high failure rates. By replacing static logic with a dynamic, data-driven approach, it boosts transaction success from 20.10% to 68.44% and reduces costs by 13.25%, enhancing customer satisfaction and profitability.
